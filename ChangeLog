	* ChangeLog: Added ChangeLog
	* TODO: Added TODO
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Started arduino communication
	implementation. Need to revise how StandardFirmata code should be
	interacted with.
	* src/motor/motor.h, src/motor/motor.c: Started motor interface.
	* src/common.h: Added src/common.h

2014-2-24 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* CMakeLists.txt, src/CMakeLists.txt: Added cmake build system.
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Implemented new protocol.
	* src/comm/opcodes.h: Added the new opcodes.
	* src/motor/motor.h, src/motor/motor.c: Added motor and servo control
	wrapper calls to underlying write commands.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added src/ui/main.c to act as our mockup main.
	* src/common.h: Added the motor, servo, and pin type declerations.
	* TODO: updated TODO.

2014-2-26 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/comm/msgqueue.c: Added the rov_msgqueue
	to handle the new messages.
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Changed to a queue based system as
	opposed to having direct to the arduino. This allows us to use the wait
	and start commands.

2014-2-28 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/ui/screen.h, src/ui/screen.c: Started working on the screen UI.
	* scr/common.h: Added the screen declerations.

2014-3-3 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/ui/screen.h, src/ui/screen.c: Got message log and static UI frame.
	* TODO: Updated TODO

2014-3-13 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.h, src/controls/keybinds.c: started keybinds.
	* build/.keybinds: example keybinds file.

2014-3-14 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.h, src/controls/keybinds.c: Finished first round
	keybinds implementation.
	* src/controls/keybinds-parser.scm: Added a scheme program to parse
	the .keybinds file into usable data.
	* build/.keybinds: Final version of example .keybinds file added.
	* build/.keybinds_rand: A file with random keybinds that varies from the
	defualt keybinds to test that parsing is done correctly.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added a test main that shows the output of the parsed
	.keybinds file.

2014-3-14 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.h, src/control.keybinds.c: Added more operations
	and fixed button/axis lists.
	* src/controls/keybinds-parser.scm: Added support for more operations,
	and made (axis-pair a b) subtract 1 from a and b to give the button
	number like (button n). Also made it verify the length of the arg lists
	at this stage as opposed to the C-step.
	* build/.keybinds, build/.keybinds_rand: Added new examples that reflect
	the new operations.
	* src/common.h: Change the joystick processing param struct to have a
	send AND poll rate.
	* src/controls/controls.c: Changed the process_joystick() loop to look
	at the poll rate.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added a new main that reflects the new operations.
