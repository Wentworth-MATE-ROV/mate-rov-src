	* ChangeLog: Added ChangeLog
	* TODO: Added TODO
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Started arduino communication
	implementation. Need to revise how StandardFirmata code should be
	interacted with.
	* src/motor/motor.h, src/motor/motor.c: Started motor interface.
	* src/common.h: Added src/common.h

2014-2-24 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* CMakeLists.txt, src/CMakeLists.txt: Added cmake build system.
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Implemented new protocol.
	* src/comm/opcodes.h: Added the new opcodes.
	* src/motor/motor.h, src/motor/motor.c: Added motor and servo control
	wrapper calls to underlying write commands.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added src/ui/main.c to act as our mockup main.
	* src/common.h: Added the motor, servo, and pin type declerations.
	* TODO: updated TODO.

2014-2-26 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/comm/msgqueue.c: Added the rov_msgqueue
	to handle the new messages.
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Changed to a queue based system as
	opposed to having direct to the arduino. This allows us to use the wait
	and start commands.

2014-2-28 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/ui/screen.h, src/ui/screen.c: Started working on the screen UI.
	* scr/common.h: Added the screen declerations.

2014-3-3 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/ui/screen.h, src/ui/screen.c: Got message log and static UI frame.
	* TODO: Updated TODO

2014-3-13 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.h, src/controls/keybinds.c: started keybinds.
	* build/.keybinds: example keybinds file.

2014-3-14 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.h, src/controls/keybinds.c: Finished first round
	keybinds implementation.
	* src/controls/keybinds-parser.scm: Added a scheme program to parse
	the .keybinds file into usable data.
	* build/.keybinds: Final version of example .keybinds file added.
	* build/.keybinds_rand: A file with random keybinds that varies from the
	defualt keybinds to test that parsing is done correctly.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added a test main that shows the output of the parsed
	.keybinds file.

2014-3-14 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.h, src/control.keybinds.c: Added more operations
	and fixed button/axis lists.
	* src/controls/keybinds-parser.scm: Added support for more operations,
	and made (axis-pair a b) subtract 1 from a and b to give the button
	number like (button n). Also made it verify the length of the arg lists
	at this stage as opposed to the C-step.
	* build/.keybinds, build/.keybinds_rand: Added new examples that reflect
	the new operations.
	* src/common.h: Change the joystick processing param struct to have a
	send AND poll rate.
	* src/controls/controls.c: Changed the process_joystick() loop to look
	at the poll rate.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added a new main that reflects the new operations.
2014-3-15 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds-parser.scm: Added a gen-op macro that will let
	me more quickly add operations in the future, while assuring they are
	correct. Also made all-buttons? and all-axis? check for length to
	simplify the macro. Thanks to Jack Pugmire for the scheme help.

2014-3-18 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/keybinds.c: Shortened the call to read_jsevent by
	unioning the axis name with an array of axes where the name and number
	relate.
	* src/common.h, src/controls/keybinds.h: Moved the definiton of
	rov_jsaxis and rov_joystick to common, and added the union as described.
	Also made rov_arduino contain an rov_keybinds structure.
	* src/ui/keyboard.h, src/ui/keyboard.c: Added these to handle keyboard
	interaction with the ROV program. Currently support 'l': reload the
	.keybinds file at runtime.
	* TODO: Updated TODO.

2014-3-22 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* lib/*: Moved screen and library functions into their own libraries to
	be linked with the main project.
	* src/ui/main: Made the changes for the libraries.
	* src/ui/controls.c: Removed all library functions.
	* src/common.h: Removed the structures defined by my new libraries.
	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Added the static linking of the 2 libraries.
	* src/librov/*: Added headers for librov.

2014-4-21 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/pinlayout.h, src/controls/pinlayout.c: Added a
	configurable pin layout parsing mechanism.
	* src/ui/main.c: Added the sections to read from the .pins file.
	* src/controls/controls.c: Started sending the proper signals to the
	arduino.

2014-4-21 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/ui/keyboard.h, src/ui/keyboard.c: Added a feature to load the
	pin layout at runtime.
	* src/comm/opcode.h: Added the pinstate opcode.
	* src/comm/comm.h, src/comm/comm.c: Added the set_pinstate() functions
	to set a pin to input or output.
	* src/arduino.c: Added src/arduino.c

2014-4-24 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/micro/arduino.c, src/micro/recv.c: Added a directory for the
	code on microcontrollers.
	* src/controls/controls.c: Changed the joystick behavior for button
	* build/.pins: Added a sample pin config file.
	* src/motor/motor.c, src/motor/motor.h: Removed these files.
	* src/controls/pinlayout.h, src/controls/pinlayout.c, src/common.h:
	Removed motor structs and have the arduino hold it's own state, motors
	are represented as unsigned char's and lights as bools.
	* src/ui/main.c: Updated init_arduino() call.

2014-4-27 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/controls/controls.c: Changed the scaling from [0,1023] to [0,255]
